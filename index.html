    <p style="font-size:40px;">Displayed above is a map comparing peak AM and PM ridership at various D.C. Metro locations. In yellow is peak AM boardings at a station, while peak PM boardings are displayed in orange. The two are displayed as a proportion of the total peak AM and PM boardings, which is represented by the size of the circle. The purpose of the map is to find which stations commuters come from and which stations commuters come to, particularly concerning whether the sation is inside or outside DC. The map shows that nearly every central D.C. station is a destination, while most stations in NW and SE D.C. actually have more AM boardings than PM. Nearly every station outside D.C. follows suit, except for some stations in Montgomery County and Arlingtoon County. Not coincidentally, these stations are often correlated to large government facilities, with the Pentagon in Arlington County and NIH/Walter Reed in Montgomery County. I chose this because growing up in Rockville, the Metro is a key aspect of transportation in the area. I would often take the Metro to go on trips into D.C., and my father takes the Metro to go to work each morning. It would be interesting to compare these stats, and ridership in total, across the different Metro lines (part of the Metro stations CSV) in the future.</p>
